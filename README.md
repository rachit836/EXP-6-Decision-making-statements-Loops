Sure! Here's the **updated and combined experiment journal** with the **hourglass pattern** using nested `for` loops instead of the 5x5 star square.

## **Experiment Journal: Loop-Based Programs and Nested Loops in C++**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Aim:**

To understand and implement basic and nested looping structures (`for` and `while` loops) in C++. The experiments include:

1. Printing even numbers from 0 to 10 using a `for` loop
2. Printing a sentence multiple times using a `for` loop
3. Printing numbers from 1 to 20 using a `while` loop
4. Creating a simple system locker using a `while` loop
5. Generating an hourglass pattern using nested `for` loops

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Tools Used:**

* Programiz C++ online compiler

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Theory:**

Loops in C++ execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. The two primary loop structures are:

* **`for` loop**: Used when the number of iterations is known. Combines initialization, condition check, and increment/decrement in one line.
* **`while` loop**: Used when the number of iterations is unknown and continues looping while a condition remains true.

---

#### âœ… **`for` Loop Syntax:**

```cpp
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // statements
}
```

---

#### âœ… **`while` Loop Syntax:**

```cpp
while(condition) {
    // statements
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Programs and Descriptions:**

---

#### âœ… **Q1. Print Even Numbers from 0 to 10 Using `for` Loop**

Prints even numbers by incrementing the loop counter by 2.

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

---

#### âœ… **Q2. Print a Sentence Using `for` Loop**

Prints the same sentence 5 times.

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    cout << "This is a repeated sentence." << endl;
}
```

---

#### âœ… **Q3. Print Numbers from 1 to 20 Using `while` Loop**

Prints numbers from 1 to 20 using a condition-checked loop.

```cpp
int i = 1;
while(i <= 20) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

---

#### âœ… **Q4. System Locker Using `while` Loop**

Simulates a password system that keeps prompting until the correct password `"admin123"` is entered.

```cpp
string password;
while(password != "admin123") {
    cout << "Enter password: ";
    cin >> password;
}
cout << "Access granted!";
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Nested `for` Loops: Hourglass Pattern**

---

#### âœ… **Theory:**

Nested `for` loops allow iteration over multiple levels, such as rows and columns. They are particularly useful for **pattern printing** tasks like hourglasses, pyramids, and diamonds.

---

#### âœ… **Example: Hourglass Star Pattern**

This program prints an hourglass pattern of stars using nested loops.

**Code:**

```cpp
int n = 5;

// Upper half
for(int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
    for(int space = 0; space < n - i; space++) {
        cout << " ";
    }
    for(int star = 1; star <= 2*i - 1; star++) {
        cout << "*";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

// Lower half
for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    for(int space = 0; space < n - i; space++) {
        cout << " ";
    }
    for(int star = 1; star <= 2*i - 1; star++) {
        cout << "*";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

**Output:**

```
*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

### ðŸ”¹ **Conclusion:**

Through these experiments, I have:

* Practiced using `for` and `while` loops for repeating tasks and condition-based logic
* Built a simple password verification system
* Learned how to use **nested `for` loops** to create structured patterns such as an hourglass

These programs have strengthened my understanding of loops in C++ and shown how they can be applied to solve both simple and complex problems.

Would you like help adding variations of the hourglass, comments to the code, or visual explanations for how the loops work?
